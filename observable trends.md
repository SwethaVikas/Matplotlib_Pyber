Written description of three observable trends based on the data of Pyber Rides of cities.

1.By visualizing Pyber Ride Sharing and Total Fares By City Types plot  we can say that there are more total fares in Urban areas but Average Fare is higher in Rural Areas.

2.By visualizing Total Rides By City Types plots we can say that majority of rides are taken in the urban areas followed by suburban areas.

4.By visualizing Total Drivers By City Types plots we can say that majority of drivers are located in the urban areas followed by suburban areas and rural areas have only 2.6% of total driver count.

Finally, From above analysis we can predict that there are many new opportunities to expand the business in Suburban and Rural cities. Therefore more focus can be applied on increasing the driver count and availablity of ride sharing through more advertising in the rural areas.
